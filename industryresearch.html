    <h1>Industry Research</h1>
    <p>This page contains a rough record of the research of the history of Point Of Sale systems.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The first Point of Sales system invented by James Ritty in 1879, was obviously much more primitive compared to later iterations of the device. Ritty's version of the PoS system simply recorded the number of sales and amount of each one. Overall, the original PoS system was basically a cash register. However, the device wouldn't stay stagnant in its current state as after the patent was sold, the new owners, National Cash Register (NRC) would begin to implement changes to the device consistently throughout the ages as technology has seen unbelievable innovations and businesses now require much more than a basic sales counting system. Throughout the early 1900s, the PoS was still a basic cash register that included extra functionalities compared to the first iteration. Now including a cash drawer and receipt printing, However, the first PoS system that is like our project wasn't created until 1973</p>

<p>In 1973, IBM created a PoS system that is like what is seen today. The system was more of a central management hub rather than a cash register as it controlled up to 128 cash registers, showing the PoS system advancing to what is today.</p>

<p>Following this, McDonalds introduced their own take on the PoS system that introduced innovations to suit the restaurant setting.</p>

<p>The restaurant PoS system differs greatly from the general PoS system as it does much more than just record sales and print receipts. It allows customers to choose the specifics of their meals. Whether they want a drink with their meal, a diet replacement, small or large? Due to this, The PoS for restaurants need much more functionality and for that reason, innovations are required not only for improvement but sheer functionality.</p>

<p>With this technology, the device allowed restaurants to function with greater efficiency as with a press of a button, the order was taken with all its specifics, sent to the kitchen and begins preparation in seconds</p>

<p>The 1990s brought great innovations for PoS system with technological advancements such as a touch screen interface that was used across all PoS systems irrelevant of industry. The new makeover during the 1990s are a lot like the devices used today. It is evident that the PoS was moving towards being something greater than a glorified cash register. The PoS system was becoming a global retail management device as seen today.</p>

<p>In this current day, the PoS system has become an Omni-Channel system which will be further covered in the innovations section.</p>
    <h3>Innovations</h3>
    <p>The Point of Sale system, abbreviated POS is utilized by millions of people throughout the world every day. 
      Many businesses generally make use of Point of Sales systems to assist with the purchases of goods and services. 
      The POS is different for every business, as it is individually tailored to each individual business and their different requirements and in a way is an innovation in and of itself. 
      The majority of businesses using POS have in a way innovated the system or changed how their particular POS works compared to a POS of another business. 
      This is because each business has their own particular requirements and they all operate differently, resulting in different Point of Sale systems. 
      Some of the more technical innovations comes with the introduction of cardless transactions and mobile payments. 
      This digital innovation has paved the way for many businesses as the ever-growing technological age advances further. 
      With cash slowly being pushed out of business, it’s no wonder that businesses have developed their POS systems to support cashless payments and the ability to pay with your mobile phone. 
      The push for a digital age has been welcomed by businesses adopting the POS system as it rids the need of price tags. 
      Prices can now be updated through the POS system itself and removes the need for replacing old price tags with new ones whenever a price change was needed. 
      With the introduction of cloud-computing, that is, the ability to store, manage and process data over the internet, POS systems have adopted the ability to store their data in a remote server rather than locally. 
      As a result, local hardware is not required due to the server being stored within the ‘cloud’. 
      Additionally, cloud-based point of sale systems generally have a centralized data storage which gives the business the ability to access this information from anywhere given there is an internet connection. 
      The evolution and innovative ways that businesses have adapted to implement these point of sale systems has helped tremendously in many different fields and has modernised the ways of in store purchases. </p>
