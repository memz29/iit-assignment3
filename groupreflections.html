          <p>Similarly, to the previous assignment, our group’s ability to work as a team has once again been displayed. 
              The collective effort of all the group members was something that has made working within this group an enjoyable and memorable experience. 
              Something that could have been improved upon was yet again the ability to coordinate meetings effectively. 
              Due to the current circumstances in Victoria and everybody’s different schedules, scheduling a time has proven to be difficult yet again and could be improved upon. 
              One thing that stood out however was how well the group’s abilities were able to intertwine with one another in the sense that while some of us lacked skills in HTML, 
              others were able to step up to the task with their knowledge and expertise within that field which allowed the group to work with their strengths and as a result, 
              tasks were delegated accordingly. GitHub, although being a challenging platform to work on, 
              was rewarding in that we were able to see what each member was contributing to the assignment and allowed us to individually push our changes as required. </p>
